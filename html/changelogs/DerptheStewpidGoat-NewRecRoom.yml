  - rscadd: "Added a new recreation room to replace the rarely-used holodeck. Has a nice table for chatting with your fellow grey tide committee and a few arcade machines if you're looking to robust time. Also comes stocked with 2 easels and plenty of canvas for anyone feeling a bit artsy. Simply slap the canvas on the easel then begin clicking on it with a crayon."
