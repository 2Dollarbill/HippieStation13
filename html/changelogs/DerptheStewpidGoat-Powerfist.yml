  - rscadd: "Powerfist added! It's available to any traitor for 14 TC. When wielded in both hands (one glove holds the power fist while the other houses the battery pack), the user can smash any target across a room with moderate damage and some stamina damage. Needs to charge automatically in-between punches, but the time needed to charge is negligible. Does NOT go in your gloves slot, instead, it must be wielded in both hands to function."
