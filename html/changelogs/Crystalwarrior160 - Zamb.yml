changes: 
  - tweak: "You will no longer transform into a Zombie if you're alive. Zombie virus now requires you to be dead for transformation to happen."
  - tweak: "Zombies now fully take the armor into account. If you see a zombie with ablative armor chances are lasers won't do as much damage to it."
  - tweak: "Made zombie bites warn the zombie whether or not the infection passed - this helps convey to zombies that biosuits/spacesuits have a chance to protect against bites."
