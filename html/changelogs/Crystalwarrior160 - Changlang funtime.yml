changes: 
  - rscadd: "Digital Camo no longer makes you an obvious target. Instead, when used, it'll slow your chemical production rates much like mimic voice."
  - rscadd: "Horror form now has a very long-range scream that is also reverbed! Super spooky. Ctrl+S or *scream work."
  - tweak: "Cryosting nerfed to use 25 chemicals and only inject 10 frostoil. Can still inject 30 frostoil into peopple if you waste all of your chemicals doing so."
  - tweak: "Death sting now gives you 10 wasting toxin. Wasting toxin metabolization rate slightly increased, wasting toxin blood drain tweaked."
  - tweak: "Changeling Horror Form no longer has passive health regeneration."
  - tweak: "Changeling Horror Form will now gib bodies when devouring them if their overall brute loss is more than or equeal to 300."
  - tweak: "Fixed weird timing when transforming back to human from horror form."
  - bugfix: "Fixed digital camo acting extremely weird"
