changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds garrots into the game! They are similar to damp rags in functionalty, but have a different purpose. It's MUCH faster to choke someone out with a garrot.  There are two ways to craft it:  Using table, put a single rod, 15 cables and have a welding tool in-hand. Drag&Drop the table on yourself and select 'Garrote Handles'. Apply 20 cables on the created garrot handles.  Doing it the old-fashioned way, you need to make a wire rod, apply welder on it and then apply 20 cables on the created garrot handles."
  - bugfix: "Damp rag and garrot are now only added to processing objects when neccesary, this oughta reduce lag."
  - tweak: "Increased movement delay for KILL grabs so you're even less mobile."
