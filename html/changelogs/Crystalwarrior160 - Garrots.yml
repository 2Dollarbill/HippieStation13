changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds garrots into the game! They are similar to damp rags in functionalty, but have a different purpose. It's MUCH faster to choke someone out with a garrot. To craft it, you need to make a wire rod, apply welder on it and then apply 20 cables on the created garrot handles."
  - bugfix: "Damp rag and garrot are now only added to processing objects when neccesary, this oughta reduce lag."
